# TIME-SERIES
The project focuses on utilizing advanced time series forecasting techniques, specifically the ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) model, to gain insights into the air quality trends in Andhra Pradesh over a five-year period, spanning from 2017 to 2021. This analysis not only provides a comprehensive retrospective view of air quality fluctuations but also extends forward to predict air quality for an additional year.

Drawing upon a rich dataset of air quality metrics, this project employs ARIMA modeling to identify patterns, trends, and seasonality within the air quality data. By applying this rigorous statistical approach, we aim to offer reliable predictions of air quality for the year following the provided dataset.
Some of the time series graphs are given below
